## Design for the app
### Frontend:

Use React native JavaScript to create a web application that replicates the design provided in the Figma.

Implement a form to add new invoices by the user for better testing and performance.

Implement a dashboard that shows the list of invoices. Each invoice should display the customer name, invoice number, and pending amount.

Allow the user to select an invoice from the list to edit the amount and select the payment method.

Once the user has made their changes, provide a "confirm" button that submits the updated invoice data to the backend.

On successful payment, display a success screen that acknowledges the payment success.

### Backend:

Create a database schema that accommodates the invoices, which includes fields for customer name, invoice number, amount, and payment status and more info from the BE sheeet.

Build an Insert API that allows the frontend to add new invoices to the database.

Build a Read API that retrieves the invoice data from the database and sends it to the frontend for display.

Build a Payment API that updates the invoice's pending amount and payment status after the user has made a payment.

Ensure that the backend APIs are secured and that appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.

Test the backend APIs to ensure that they are working correctly, and handle any errors or exceptions that may arise during the process.
